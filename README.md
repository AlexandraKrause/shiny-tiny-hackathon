# Appsilon’s Tiny Shiny Hackathon: Build, Compete, and Win!

We are excited to invite you to the Appsilon Tiny Shiny Hackathon, a four-hour online challenge where developers can showcase their creativity and technical skills by building applications that combine Shiny and AI.

Whether you are a seasoned developer or just starting with Shiny, this is a great opportunity to push your limits, learn from others, and gain recognition in the Shiny community.

## Why Join?
This hackathon is not just about coding. It is about innovation, collaboration, and learning. Here is what you can look forward to:

* Exclusive prizes for top submissions.
* A feature at ShinyConf 2025, putting your work in front of the global Shiny community.
* A one-on-one mentoring session with Appsilon’s Head of Technology, Marcin Dubel.
* If you are passionate about building with Shiny and want to experiment with AI, this is your chance to put your skills to the test.

## What to Expect
Taking place on Saturday, March 22, 2025, this hackathon runs for just four hours. You will receive access to a GitHub repository with the challenge description at the start, and from there, it is all about designing, developing, and submitting a working Shiny application.

You can participate solo or team up with a partner. Whether you choose R or Python, the goal is the same. Create an impressive Shiny app that meets the challenge criteria. AI tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, Cursor, and Shiny Assistant are not just allowed. They are encouraged.

## How to Participate

2. Make sure you have an active GitHub account.
3. (Optional) Join the opening call to get important details.
4. Once the hackathon begins, access the GitHub repository with the challenge.
5. Fork the repository and start coding.
6. Submit your pull request before the deadline with your completed app.
7. How We Will Evaluate Your Work
8. Submissions will be reviewed by the Hackathon Committee, made up of Appsilon experts. They will be looking at:

  * How well your app meets the challenge objectives.
  * Any additional features you build.
  * UI design and user experience.
  * Code clarity and maintainability.

## Prizes and Recognition
Winning is not just about prizes. It is about getting your work in front of the right people. Here is what is at stake:
